The [COSMOS](https://cosmos.astro.caltech.edu) field is one of the most extensively observed regions in the extragalactic sky. At IAP we have been involved in the COSMOS project since the beginning, processing the very  COSMOS observations with [Megacam](https://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/Instruments/Imaging/MegaPrime/) which defined the astrometric reference frame which would be used later to define targets for the [zCOSMOS](https://www.phys.ethz.ch/lilly/research/zcosmos.html) spectroscopic survey.

Every major observatory has taken data in COSMOS and every future observatory or instrument has COSMOS in its observing schedules. The rich combination of very deep optical, infrared, near-infrared data available in COSMOS means that it has become one of the reference fields for the extragalactic sky. This unique combination of multi-wavelength observations and very well-sampled spectroscopic data means that COSMOS samples uniquely the distribution of galaxies from 0<z<10.

At IAP we have led the preparation of the COSMOS2015 and COSMOS2020 catalogues, processed and made available the entire dataset for the UltraVISTA deep survey. We are currently processing COSMOSWeb survey, the largest Cycle 1 JWST proposal. 

All these datasets, both pixels and catalogues, are made available here.
