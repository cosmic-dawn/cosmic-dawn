The COSMOS field is one of the most extensively observed regions in the extragalactic sky. At IAP we have been involved in the COSMOS project since the beginning  of the project, processing the first MEGACAM COSMOS observations which enabled the definition of an astrometric reference frame which would be used for the ZCOSMOS spectroscopic survey.

 In this page we make available all the imaging data using to make the COSMOS2020 catalogues. It is really important and fantastic!
